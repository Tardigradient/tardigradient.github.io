          <i>What do I do in this treasure hunt?</i> Use the map and the riddle that you receive to lead you along a path of clues that will help you find the hidden treasure chest! Feel free to work with a friend to crack the code. Most of the clues are outside, so dress warm! <br><br>
          <i>Where might the treasure be hidden?</i> The treasure is hidden somewhere on the USU campus. You will not need to leave campus at any time in order to find it. <br><br>
          <i>What is the treasure?</i> The contents of the chest are a secret, but they are worth the effort to find! <br><br>
          <i>When does the treasure hunt take place?</i> The treasure hunt will begin on March 1st, 2026. Registration begins January 5th and will be open for the duration of the treasure hunt, which will of course end when somebody discovers the location of the chest!<br><br>
          <i>Can I start hunting right now?</i> No. We will not put out the treasure or any of the clues until the hunt officially begins on March 1. Perhaps you could ponder upon the map and the initial riddle until then. <br><br>
