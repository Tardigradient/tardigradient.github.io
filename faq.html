          <strong>What will I do in this treasure hunt?</strong><br>
          Use the map and the riddle that you receive to lead you along a path of clues that will help you find the hidden treasure chest! 
          Feel free to work with a friend to crack the code, or go at it alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What's in the chest?</strong><br>
          The exact contents of the chest are a secret, but they are worth more than a bit of effort! 
          The chest includes items provided by Chick-Fil-A, Angie's, and Raising Cane's, as well as some other things.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Where might the treasure be hidden?</strong><br>
          The treasure is hidden somewhere on the USU campus. You will not need to leave campus at any time in order to find it. 
          Most of the places you need to go are outdoors, so dress warm! 
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How hard is the treasure hunt?</strong><br>
          It's difficult. We expect it to last at least until the end of March before someone finds the treasure. We will release occasional hints via email.
          For an example of what you could be dealing with and the difficulty level we were sort of aiming for, check out the

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>When does the treasure hunt take place?</strong><br>
          The treasure hunt will officially begin on March 1st, 2026. Registration will be open January 5th and will remain open for the duration of the treasure hunt, 
          which will of course end when somebody discovers the location of the chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Can I start hunting right now?</strong><br>
          We will not put out the treasure chest or any of the clues until March 1, 
          but perhaps you could ponder upon the initial riddle until then.
