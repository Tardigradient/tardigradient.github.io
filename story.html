In 1818, the French privateer Hippolyte Bouchard raided missions along the coast of California. Rumors have said that on the brink of demise, he left a buried cache of his stolen treasure. Years later in 1869 (during the California gold rush), The Pratt expedition, led by Thomas Pratt and other Mormon prospectors, traveled to California in search of gold to support their new Utah community. In their prospecting, they stumbled upon the Bouchard cache! They quickly returned to their home valley in Utah, which they named the CACHE VALLEY after their newfound riches. Community members expected Pratt to share the wealth, but overcome with greed, he stowed it away once again. There was a map, however it was so vague that only Thomas could understand it, and before long, Thomas and everyone else in his company mysteriously passed away. Fast forward to today, and just the other month, a riddle was rediscovered by USU history researchers going through old papers here on campus. Could this riddle lead to the hidden Bouchard Cache?
