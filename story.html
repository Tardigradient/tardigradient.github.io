        In 1818, the feared French Argentine privateer Hippolyte Bouchard raided missions along the coast of California. Rumors have said that, fearing an assasination 
        attempt would take place, he left a buried cache of his stolen treasure somewhere not far from the shore. Sure enough, on January 4th, 1837, he was murdered by 
        one of his servants. Years later in 1869 (during the California gold rush), The Pratt expedition, led by Thomas Pratt and other Mormon prospectors, traveled to 
        California in search of gold to support their new Utah community. In their prospecting, they stumbled upon the Bouchard cache! They quickly returned to their 
        home valley in Utah, which they named the CACHE VALLEY after their newfound riches. Community members expected Pratt to share the wealth, but overcome with greed, 
        he stowed it away once again. Pratt scrawled a map on the back of a playing card, but it was so vague that only he knew what it meant. Before long, Thomas and 
        everyone else in his company mysteriously passed away, and the legendary Bouchard  Cache was lost to history. That is, until just the other month, when a worn 
        paper with a cryptic riddle scrawled on it was rediscovered by USU history researchers going through old papers here on campus. 
        Could this riddle unlock the secret lead to the hidden Bouchard Cache?

        Only the cleverest adventurers will be able to decipher the clues, follow the map, 
        and claim the bounty within! The first to find the chest will be the rightful owner of whatever 
        lies inside.
