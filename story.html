        <br><strong>Legend whispers of a treasure chest hidden somewhere on the USU campus... </strong><br><br>But how did it get here?<br><br> 
        In 1818, the feared French Argentine privateer Hippolyte Bouchard raided missions along the coast of California. Legend has it that, fearing an assasination 
        attempt would take place, he left a secret cache of his stolen treasure in a cave somewhere not far from the shore. Sure enough, on January 4th, 1837, he was 
        murdered by one of his servants.<br><br>
        Years later in 1869, the Pratt Expedition, led by Thomas Pratt and other Mormon prospectors, traveled to California in search of gold to support their new Utah 
        community. They arrived at the tail end of the California gold rush, and their expectations were small. However, in their prospecting, they happened to stumble 
        upon the long-lost Bouchard cache! They quickly returned to their home valley in Utah, which they named the CACHE VALLEY after their newfound riches. Community 
        members expected Pratt to share the wealth, but overcome with greed, he instead stowed it away. Pratt drew a map on the back of a playing card to help him 
        remember the chest's location, but it was so vague that only he knew what it meant. Before long, Thomas Pratt and everyone else in his company mysteriously 
        passed away, and the legendary Bouchard Cache was again lost to history.<br><br>
        Rumors have said that the spot where Pratt left his chest was located on a piece of land that in 1888 became a part of the new Agricultural College of Utah. But 
        nobody knew for sure... that is, until just the other day, when a worn paper with a cryptic riddle scrawled on it was rediscovered by USU history researchers 
        going through historic documents here on campus. Could this riddle unlock the secret to the hidden Bouchard Cache?
